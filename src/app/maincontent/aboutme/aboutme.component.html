                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div>As a frontend developer, I specialize in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I
                    work
                    daily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design dynamic and responsive web applications. My role
                    involves
                    bridging the gap between design and technology, translating designs into functional websites. </div>
